Her Ph.D. research topic in this area is \"User acceptance implications for Human-Machine Interfaces in shared autonomous vehicles\u2014\u2014Study of HMI for automated shuttle buses through VR prototyping and evaluation.\"</p> <p>Since 2013, her attention has concentrated on the opportunities that smarts and interactive artifacts offer for creating an engaging user experience. Specific research topics she has addressed in this field are Aesthetics of Interaction, Product's Multi-Sensory Language, Tangible Interaction, and Design for Behaviour Change. She has published widely on these topics in both Chinese and English.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#research-interests","title":"Research interests","text":"<p> <ul> <li>Human-Machine Interfave (in autonomous vehicles)</li> <li>Interactive design</li> <li>Industrial Product Design</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"#working-and-education-experience","title":"Working and Education Experience","text":"<p> <ul> <li>2020.09-2025.05: PhD in Design, Department of Design, Politecnico di Milano, Italy;</li> <li>2019.01-2019.06: Exchange program, Audencia Business School, France;</li> <li>2017.09-2020.05: Interaction Design, School of Art and Media, Tongji University, China;</li> <li>2017.07-2017.08: Huangshan Hand-painted Factory,China;
